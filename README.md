# Objective
Seed application demonstrating the use of the Golden Layout project within an Angular context to load a
dynamic layout configuration to the screen.

# Install Procedure
```bower install```

```npm install```

# To Run
``npm start``

# Interesting things left to do:
1. Save config to cookie store
2. Check config from the cookie store before loading (normally this would be server persisted).
3. Implement maximize and close code.
4. Add some more interesting data into the widgets.
